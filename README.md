### GitHub commits
## Explained in simple lines

**In order to understand properly all changes made in the GitHub Repositories a small description is attributed in every single update.**

**These descriptions will follow certain guidelines, in order to explain in a concise manner the changes made in the repository.**

**The following list will try to summarize the format utilized in the repositories:**

	1: Features will be indicated with the abrevation "feat". Square brackets may be used. E.g: "feat: "; "[feat] "; [feat]: ".
	All these different options are accepted, however it is recommended to make use of a singular format for all the despriptive commit messages.

	2: Hotfixes will be indicated with the abrevation "fix". As with the features, square brackets may be used. E.g: "fix: "; "[fix]:"; "[fix] ". As with the features, it is highly recommended to stick with one single format across all the descriptive commit messages.

	3: All descriptive messages stated in the commit changes should be below 72 characters. This is in order so that it remains readable at a first glance. If the text lenght surpases 72 characters, the entire text will not be able to be read at a first glance and the user will need to open the message manually in order to read it fully, making a potential analysis more tedious and labourous.

	4: In the descriptive message any file names will not be referenced directly by their name.
